Project Title - NYC Bus Breakdown and Delay Analysis: Understanding the Key Factors Behind Transit Disruptions

Project Description - This project analyzes the causes and patterns behind bus delays and breakdowns across New York City. By exploring multiple factors such as bus company, borough, routes, and causal variations, I identified key drivers of delays and breakdowns recommending strategies for improving public transit efficiency.

Motivation - The NYC transit system is essential for millions of daily commuters. Understanding the causes of delays and breakdowns can lead to better planning, efficient resource allocation, and improved service. This project focuses on uncovering the factors behind delays and breakdowns in the city's bus system, ultimately aiming to contribute to a smoother, more reliable public transportation experience.

Data Source - The dataset was sourced from the NYC Open Data - Bus Breakdown & Delays (DOE) (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bus-Breakdown-and-Delays/ez4e-fazm/about_data), containing detailed records of bus delays and breakdowns by route, bus company, borough, and weather conditions.

Questions Answered / Objectives - The main questions explored in this project were: 1. What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns? 2. How do delay times vary by bus company and borough? 3. Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays? 4. Are certain bus routes more prone to delays or breakdowns than others? 5. How do breakdowns or delays vary across different seasons?

Methodology - To answer the questions, I followed these steps: - Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and converting time-related columns into usable formats. - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used descriptive statistics, group-by operations, and visualizations (e.g., bar charts, heatmaps) to identify patterns. - Statistical Analysis: Applied forecasting and hypothesis testing to determine if certain factors significantly influenced delays and breakdowns.

Results & Insights -

    What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns?
    
        The top reasons for delays include Heavy Traffic (67%), Other (19%), and Mechanical Problems (5%).
        Mechanical Problems were the leading cause of breakdowns, accounting for 57% of all incidents, followed by Won't Start (16%), Flat Tire (14%), and Other (9%).
    
    How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?
    
        Bus Companies: Selby Transportation, Little Linda Bus Co, and Pride Transportation rank among the higest average delays among all of the Bus Companies, ranging from 70 - 60 minute delays respectively.
        Boroughs: The Buroughs with the largest average delays aligns with those with the highest concentration of people, with the top 3 including Manhattan and Queens. Both of which offering over 40 minute average delays.
    
    Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?
    
        Delays were more frequent on Mondays, with a large reduction on Fridays. While Fridays are likely seeing a reduced number of delays due to fewer people commuting to work, Mondays are more abstract and require further information to properly understand.
        Breakdown frequency follows the same pattern as the delays, however less severe. The increase at the beginning of the week may suggest a need for maintenance to be scheduled over the weekends in preperation for the week ahead.
